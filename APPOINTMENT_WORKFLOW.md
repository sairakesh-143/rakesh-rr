## Firebase Rules Required
```javascript
// Firestore Security Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Appointments - users can only read their own
    match /appointments/{appointmentId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow update: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Notifications - users can only read their own
    match /notifications/{notificationId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      allow update: if request.auth != null && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```
